# Cover_Me

### Authors

## Description

We will create a CLI app that will build a web scraper from job search site indeed.com. We will collect data for job listings in the tech industry such as company name, skills, education level, salary detail, etc. and then allow users to search for jobs by keyword and location. User will be able to save jobs they are interested in to a file and run the job's data through AI to produce a sample cover letter for that job.

This program helps users find relevant and recent job listings in the tech industry, select listings they like, and prompt AI to process the listing's data to produce a sample cover letter for the given job posting.

## CLI wireframe

__1. User launches the CLI app__
